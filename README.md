# Learn Ruby on Rails
This repo is for learning Ruby on Rails. Don't be too judgmental!

## Environment
### Local Install
I am running Windows 8.1 x64, Atom, Nitrous.io w/ Desktop sync and GitHub for
Windows. No, I don't own a mac.
https://atom.io/


### Online Services
Github: https://github.com

Nitrous.io (Ruby on Rails dev environment): https://www.nitrous.io/

Atom (local text editor):

### Instructions
I got my start at the Odin Project, but decided to keep the laptop environment
to a minimum.

I took the middle ground of going the Nitrous.io approach, but with a local
text editor, git client and synchronisation with Nitrous.io. Point the text
editor to the local git repository, and sync the same folder with Nitrous.io.
Local edits are synced to dev immediately. Git commits/syncs manually done.
Next step, link github to heroku for instant code deploy for production.
